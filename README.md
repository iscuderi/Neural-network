This paper analyzes, from the perspective of neural networks, the dataset related to thyroid disease. It was downloaded from the 'Keel' repository (url: https://sci2s.ugr.es/keel/dataset.php?cod=67). The dataset contains 7200 instances and 21 explanatory variables.
The aim of the work was to apply neural networks in order to predict whether patients have a normal thyroid, hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism.
